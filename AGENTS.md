# AGENTS.md

Guide for AI coding agents working on the GroktoCrawl codebase.

## Experimental fork scope

This repository is `magnus919/groktocrawl-x`, an experimental fork, not a replacement
for [mainline GroktoCrawl](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl). Follow the
[experiment plan](docs/experiments/research-architecture.md). Target issues and PRs
at this repository unless the user explicitly requests an upstream contribution.

Inherited ADRs describe the starting implementation, not a veto on the experiment.
The research architecture may be replaced through new MADR records under
`docs/adr/`. For each affected decision, record retained, extended, partially
superseded, or superseded scope. Keep accepted ADR bodies immutable; update their
status/successor links and the index only when a replacement is accepted in this
fork. Keep proposed behavior separate from implemented behavior. An ADR decision
in this repository has no effect on the status of the upstream record.

On 2026-09-05 Magnus accepted foundation ADRs 0067–0070 and 0072 for a bounded
fixture-backed prototype. ADRs 0071, 0073 and 0074 remain proposed; no database,
adopted runtime or recovery infrastructure is selected. Follow the acceptance
record and remaining preflight/implementation gates. Provider spend remains zero.

Retain contribution and engineering standards: Conventional Commits with DCO
sign-off, typed async Python, relevant tests, public API/CLI/documentation parity,
webhook contracts for async endpoints, and review/check gates. Architecture changes
must update affected tests and guides rather than disabling their checks. GitHub
settings, runner access, review credentials, and publishing permissions are not
inherited with Git history; verify them before claiming CI or release readiness.

## Experimental CI

Use the independent [Runtime CI workflow](.github/workflows/runtime.yml) and
[runbook](docs/runbooks/experimental-runtime-ci.md) for this fork. It builds the
checkout on GitHub-hosted runners without publishing images. Keep the inherited
Docker Build & Publish workflow disabled; it still targets upstream infrastructure.
Verify actual workflow runs and repository rulesets before claiming gate readiness.

## Project Overview

GroktoCrawl is a self-hosted, MIT-licensed alternative to Firecrawl. It implements the Firecrawl v2 API surface as a set of Python FastAPI services running in Docker.

## Key Architecture Decisions

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) live in `docs/adr/` and capture the context and rationale behind significant design choices. Always check the ADR index at `docs/adr/README.md` before making architectural changes — existing ADRs may document constraints or rejected alternatives that inform your approach.

### Inline async processing (no RQ worker)

Jobs are processed with `asyncio.create_task()` inside the API process. Valkey persists job records, not execution: interrupted jobs are not resumed after restart, partial artifacts can remain, and undelivered webhooks are not replayed. `TaskTracker` provides only a short graceful-shutdown window. Restart-safe execution is deferred until it is an explicit product requirement; any future design must define ownership, leases, retries, cancellation, artifact consistency, and webhook idempotency in an ADR before selecting queue technology.

### Three-tier smart scraper

Tier 1: Check `/llms.txt` at the site root (one GET, whole site in markdown)
Tier 2: Request with `Accept: text/markdown` header (per-page markdown)
Tier 3: Playwright render + readability extraction

**Adapters run before tier 1.** When a URL matches a registered adapter, the adapter handles extraction with its own optimized fallback chain. If the adapter fails, the standard tier pipeline runs as normal. See `scraper-svc/scraper/adapters/base.py` for the adapter framework and `scraper-svc/scraper/adapters/` for available adapters.

**Current adapter categories (22 total):**
- **File/structured:** gutenberg (Project Gutenberg books as chapter-structured markdown), shopify (bypasses UCP content-negotiation trap on Shopify blog/content pages), youtube, bluesky, substack
- **Code:** github (file/repo), github-social (issues/PRs/discussions/releases)
- **Vulnerability/CVE:** nvd (NVD API, enriched), cveorg (MITRE CVE Program, authoritative)
- **Security/threat intelligence:** abuseipdb, censys, crtsh, exploitdb, hibp, mitreattack, otx, shodan, virustotal, vulncheck
- **Shared fallback:** `_helpers.py` provides `scrape_page()` for readability-lxml extraction, used by all security adapters

### LLM-agnostic

The agent service uses an OpenAI-compatible client. Swap the provider by changing `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, and `LLM_MODEL` in `.env`.

**Per-request model override:** `POST /v2/agent` accepts an optional `model` field in the request body. When set to a model name (e.g., `"gpt-4o"`), it overrides `LLM_MODEL` for that job. When omitted or `"default"`, the env-configured model is used. Wired through in `api.py` → `worker.py` → `research.py`.

**System prompt:** The agent's research behavior is defined by `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `EXTRACT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` constants in `research.py`. These are fixed — not configurable at runtime. They instruct the LLM to evaluate source quality, synthesize across pages, detect contradictions, and cite sources.

**Search parameters:** `POST /v2/search` accepts Firecrawl v2 `sources` and `categories` dimensions alongside `query` and `limit`. These are translated to SlopSearX categories — see `searxng_client.py` for the translation maps and `docs/adr/0013-search-architecture-with-vertical-categories.md` for the architecture.

**Search type spectrum (v0.6.0):** `POST /v2/search` now accepts `search_type` (default: `fast`):
- `fast` (<1s): current behavior — raw SlopSearX results
- `rich` (1-3s): scrapes top results and enriches with LLM synthesis

Optional `output_schema` enables structured extraction from search results (single-call: search → scrape → extract). Optional `system_prompt` guides synthesis behavior. See `docs/adr/0023-search-type-spectrum-fast-and-rich.md`. The CLI exposes `--search-type` (fast/rich), `--output-schema` (JSON string or @file.json), and `--system-prompt` flags alongside existing `--sources` and `--categories`.

### Agent Endpoint with SSE Streaming

`POST /v2/agent` now supports SSE streaming via `stream: true`. Two-phase protocol:
- **Discovery:** `sources_pending` (search results found), `source_scraped` (URL fetched) — shown as they happen
- **Synthesis:** `token` events stream the LLM's output token by token
- **Final:** `done` event with full `result`, `sources` list, and `latency_ms`

When `stream` is omitted, the existing create→poll pattern is used. The CLI defaults to streaming with `--sync` to opt out.

### Grounded Q&A (`POST /v2/answer`)

A synchronous single-turn Q&A endpoint that bridges `/v2/search` and `/v2/agent`: search → scrape top results → LLM synthesis with inline citations. Designed for 1-3s latency. Request fields: `query` (required), `num_sources` (1-20, default 5), `model` (per-request LLM override), `stream` (boolean, SSE streaming). Returns `answer` (markdown with `[N]` citation markers), `sources` (list of `{url, title, relevance}`), `citations` (index→URL mapping), `search_type`, and `latency_ms`. When `stream: true`, delivers SSE events: `sources`, `token` (individual tokens), `done` (final), and `error`.

### Crawl Engine

The crawl engine (`agent-svc/agent/crawler.py`) replaces the original stub crawl with a full recursive BFS crawler that achieves Firecrawl `/v2/crawl` feature parity.

**Core modules:**

- **`crawler.py`** (`CrawlEngine`) — BFS crawl orchestrator. Manages a queue of (url, depth) tuples, enforces `max_pages` / `max_depth` limits, uses asyncio.Semaphore for configurable concurrency, supports delay-based pacing (forces sequential), integrates with the shared `LinkExtractor` for child link discovery, and writes progress to the job store for status polling. Handles per-scrape timeouts, cancellation, and maximum-duration guards.

- **`link_extractor.py`** — Shared stateless module for extracting `<a href>` links from HTML. Used by crawl, `/v2/map`, and `llmstxt.py`. Resolves relative URLs against `base_url` (or `<base>` tag), strips fragments, filters non-http/https schemes, deduplicates within a page, and classifies links as internal/subdomain/external.

- **`sitemap_parser.py`** (`SitemapParser`) — Fetches and parses XML sitemaps. Discovers sitemap URLs from robots.txt `Sitemap:` directives (preferred) and falls back to common locations (`/sitemap.xml`, `/sitemap_index.xml`). Handles sitemap index files recursively (up to 3 levels), gzipped content, and degrades gracefully on errors.

- **`dedup.py`** (`DedupManager`) — Multi-layer deduplication for crawl pages. Layer 2: canonical tag check (`<link rel="canonical">`) — if the canonical URL was already scraped, the current page is skipped. Layer 3: SHA-256 content hash — byte-for-byte identical markdown is treated as duplicate. Canonical check always runs before content hash check.

- **`crawl_cache.py`** (`CrawlCache`) — Valkey-backed response cache with `maxAge`/`minAge` semantics. Cache keys are SHA-256 hashes of URLs. Entry includes cached_at timestamp and TTL. `maxAge` serves fresh content from cache if younger than threshold; `minAge` operates in cache-only mode (cache miss returns error). Used by `CrawlEngine` before each page scrape.

- **`crawl_stream.py`** — SSE streaming support for crawl progress. Delivers per-page events (`page`, `progress`, `done`, `error`) as pages are scraped. Handles reconnection to in-progress crawls and replay of completed results.

- **`nl_params.py`** — Natural language to crawl parameters translation. Used by `POST /v2/crawl` (when `prompt` is provided) and `POST /v2/crawl/params-preview`. Calls the LLM to derive `include_paths`, `exclude_paths`, `max_depth`, and `limit` from a user's NL description. Explicitly-set parameters override LLM-derived ones.

**Crawl API endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/v2/crawl` | Create a crawl job. Supports all Firecrawl v2 parameters (path filtering, sitemap modes, concurrency, delay, dedup, webhooks, SSE streaming, NL-to-params) |
| GET | `/v2/crawl/{job_id}` | Get crawl status with pagination (`next`), enhanced metadata (`created_at`, `completed_at`, `expires_at`, `duration`), and per-page enrichment (title, status_code, content_type, scraped_at, duration_ms) |
| DELETE | `/v2/crawl/{job_id}` | Cancel an in-progress crawl |
| GET | `/v2/crawl/{job_id}/errors` | Get per-URL errors and robots-blocked URLs with error types, HTTP status codes, and timestamps |
| GET | `/v2/crawl/{job_id}/stream` | SSE stream of crawl progress — delivers per-page events (`page`, `progress`, `done`, `error`) as pages are scraped; supports reconnection to in-progress crawls and replay of completed results |
| GET | `/v2/crawl/active` | List active/processing crawl jobs with crawl-specific fields (url, max_pages, max_depth, completed, total) |
| POST | `/v2/crawl/params-preview` | Preview LLM-derived crawl parameters from a natural-language prompt without starting a crawl |

**Concurrency model:** Configurable via `maxConcurrency` (1-50, default 3) with `asyncio.Semaphore`. When `delay` is set, concurrency is forced to 1 with `asyncio.sleep()` between scrapes. Valkey-backed distributed coordination is optional for multi-instance deployments.

**Data flow:** `POST /v2/crawl` → `api.py:create_crawl()` → `JobStore.create_job()` → `_process_crawl_async()` (background task) → `CrawlEngine.run()` → per-page: cache check → path filter → scraper fetch → canonical check → content hash dedup → link extraction → enqueue children → job store progress update. Webhooks fire per-page (`crawl.page`) and on completion (`crawl.completed`).

## Testing

```bash
# Full integration test against running Docker stack
cp .env.sample .env
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose exec agent-svc python3 /app/agent/tests/test_stack.py

# Or run inline (requires httpx)
pip install httpx
python tests/test_stack.py
```

The integration tests in `tests/test_stack.py` verify all endpoints against a live Docker stack with fixture services.

## Pull Requests, Review, and Merging

**CI on every PR:** Fast Tests, Code Quality (vulture/deptry/mypy/ruff/jscpd/gitleaks),
Docker/Integration Tests (self-hosted runner, runs when runtime code changes), and Architecture CI.
The `main required checks` ruleset requires `Code Quality Gate` and `Runtime Gate`.

**AI review loop (do not chase):** the `Droid Auto Review` workflow (`droid-review.yml`) posts review
comments as the `factory-droid` bot and NEVER approves. Each re-run re-scans the whole diff and mints
new (often minor) findings, so re-triggering it after every fix is an unbounded loop. Treat "review
passed" as: all findings from ONE review pass fixed, CI green, and no blocking (P1/P2) findings
remaining — do not iterate until the bot reports zero findings.

**Merging to `main`:** gated by the `main review policy` ruleset (1 approving review + resolved review
threads). Because the AI reviewer does not approve and human approval is often unavailable to automated
agents, the maintainer (`magnus919`) is a configured bypass actor. Merge with:
`gh pr merge <PR> --merge --delete-branch --admin`
only after CI is green and review findings are addressed.

## Making Changes

1. Edit the relevant service code under `agent-svc/` or `scraper-svc/`
2. Rebuild: `docker compose build <service>`
3. Recreate: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate <service>`
4. Test: run the integration tests

## Adding a New Endpoint

1. Add the route handler in `agent-svc/agent/api.py`
2. Add request/response models in `agent-svc/agent/models.py`
3. If the endpoint is async (returns a job ID), **it must accept a `webhook` field** and fire it on completion/failure via `deliver_webhook()` in `agent/webhook.py`
4. Rebuild the agent-svc image
5. Add a test case in `tests/test_stack.py`

## Environment Variables

See `.env.sample` for all configurable variables. The `.env` file is loaded by `docker compose` automatically via the `env_file:` directive in `docker-compose.yml`.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, invoke the `skill` tool with `skill: "graphify"` before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

### Query tuning for this repo

The graph's node labels are code identifiers and doc headings, not natural language. `graphify query` matches labels one-directionally, so wording mismatches return noise. Verified patterns (see `graphify-out/memory/` for seeded Q&As):

- **Expand vocabulary to graph labels first.** The label set is small; grep it before querying when a question uses non-identifier words. Examples: "deduplication" → `dedup` / `DedupManager`; "crawl engine" → `CrawlEngine`; "link extraction" → `extract_links()`. Ask `graphify explain "<symbol>"` to confirm exact names.
- **Avoid generic terms that exact-match endpoint names.** `crawl()`, `search()`, `map()`, `agent()` in `mcp-svc/mcp_server.py` get an exact-match bonus and flood results with the whole MCP endpoint community. Prefer file/module names (`crawler.py`) or specific classes (`CrawlEngine`).
- **`--context import` for dependency questions** (edges filtered to imports only; e.g. `graphify query "dedup manager" --context import` returns ~19 focused nodes instead of 400+). `--context call` works for call chains. Requires graphify >= 0.6.7 — older versions silently ignore the flag.
- **`--dfs` traces a chain; `--budget N` raises the output cap** (default 2000 tokens). Neither fixes bad seeds — fix seeds first via vocabulary.
- **After answering a graph question, run `graphify save-result --question "<verbatim question>" --answer "<answer>" --nodes <labels cited>`** so the Q&A becomes a node on the next `graphify update` (feedback loop, no API cost).
