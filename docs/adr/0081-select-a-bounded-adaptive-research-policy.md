# Select a Bounded Adaptive Research Policy

- Status: proposed
- Deciders: Magnus Hedemark
- Date: 2026-09-12
- Scope: experimental research architecture in `magnus919/groktocrawl-x` only
- Plan: W10; issue [#314](https://github.com/magnus919/groktocrawl-x/issues/314)
- Extends: [ADR-0070](0070-evaluate-research-policy-and-runtime-separately.md)

## Context and Problem Statement

W8 found that model-generated follow-up queries could discover useful sources,
but its planner searched on every case, admitted substantially more weak material,
and could not judge when the initial evidence was sufficient. Query formulation
alone is therefore not a safe research policy.

W10 compares fixed retrieval with four increasingly controlled adaptive policies.
The controls bind every follow-up to a declared evidence gap, reject weak query
proposals, admit sources only for declared marginal value, and stop from recorded
state. The study separates the W8 reproducibility anchor from challenge cases for
unsupported claims, contradictions, authority or currency gaps, publisher
independence, and entity ambiguity.

This record is proposed while blinded adjudication and analysis are incomplete.
Its criteria are fixed before the arm map is revealed. Proposal status does not
authorize changing the default retrieval policy.

## Decision Drivers

- Close important evidence gaps that fixed retrieval leaves open.
- Avoid unsupported high-importance claims and weak-source dilution.
- Spend additional searches and model calls only for a named, observable need.
- Make proposal admission, source admission, and stopping reproducible from
  retained state.
- Preserve bounded execution and a fixed-query fallback.
- Limit any adoption to the case types supported by matched repeated evidence.

## Considered Options

| Option | Benefit | Cost or boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Keep fixed retrieval | Lowest latency and simplest predictable path | May leave recoverable evidence gaps open |
| Adopt bounded recovery for named gap types | Spends extra work only where the study shows a repeatable benefit | Requires deterministic triggers and leaves other cases on fixed retrieval |
| Adopt the full bounded policy for the tested domain | Applies proposal gating, marginal-value admission, and deterministic stopping consistently | Adds search and model work and requires every frozen gate to pass |
| Run another experiment | Preserves uncertainty when one decision-critical question remains | Delays policy adoption and must name evidence that would change the decision |

The unconstrained W8-style planner is an ablation arm, not an adoption candidate,
unless new evidence overturns its observed inability to stop selectively.

## Decision Outcome

Pending completion of the frozen W10 analysis. The outcome must select exactly one
considered option and state:

- the eligible gap types and deterministic trigger;
- query-proposal and source-admission requirements;
- the stop rule and hard search, source, model-call, and elapsed-time budgets;
- observed benefit, harm, case interaction, and run-to-run variation;
- sensitivity to adjudication, importance weights, unavailable sources, and
  leave-one-case-out analysis;
- evidence that would reverse the decision.

Policy 5 may replace fixed retrieval for a named challenge type only when, in that
stratum and at least two of three repetitions, it improves weighted claim closure
by at least 10 percentage points, leaves no more unsupported high-importance
claims, keeps admitted-source precision within 5 percentage points of fixed
retrieval, executes at most 10% unnecessary queries after the final evidence gain,
stays within every work bound, and has no higher failure rate. Across the W8
anchor, closure and precision may each regress by no more than 2 percentage points.
If no policy clears every applicable gate, fixed retrieval remains the default.

## Consequences

Until this record is decided, the experimental stack retains fixed-query
SlopSearX retrieval as its default. W11 may prepare integration contracts but
cannot choose its adaptive control arm before W10 identifies the selected policy.

An accepted adaptive option will add explicit gap, proposal, candidate-disposition,
marginal-value, and stop state to the research path. The controller remains owner
of budgets and terminal decisions; a model cannot expand limits or publish merely
because it requests more research. A fixed-query path remains available for
ineligible cases and rollback.

## Confirmation

The decision requires the complete secret-free W10 adjudication record, primary
and adjudicated sensitivity analyses, full accounting dossier, Artifact Pyramid,
competing-hypothesis matrix, pre-mortem, and outcome report. The retained private
packet must match its frozen manifest and account for every query, candidate,
exclusion, source, failure, and adjudication. Missing or malformed review output
cannot become a favorable judgment.

CI confirms the record and its public artifacts are internally consistent. The
decision is reviewed in the W10 pull request. Acceptance applies only to the
experimental fork and does not change GroktoCrawl mainline or its production
deployment.
