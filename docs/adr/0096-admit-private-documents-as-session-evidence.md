# Admit Private Documents as Session Evidence

- Status: proposed; implementation prepared for review
- Deciders: Magnus Hedemark
- Date: 2026-10-07
- Scope: experimental fork issue [#419](https://github.com/magnus919/groktocrawl-x/issues/419)

## Context and Decision

Parse already extracts local PDF/office uploads; inherited sessions already retain
full Markdown references, synchronize writes, and expire/delete those references.
There is no reason to create another authoritative document warehouse to connect
these two paths. Admit complete parser output as an explicit document reference
in the existing session store, with separate hashes for uploaded bytes and exact
UTF-8 extracted text. Attach/detach serialize with existing session operations;
admission rejects explicit per-file/per-session limits instead of truncating.

New sessions and staged upload reservations bind to the established
credential-derived caller scope. Existing unowned session capability readers
remain compatible; attaching private documents requires a newly owned session.
Foreign callers receive a non-disclosing not-found response. Payloads cannot choose
their owner. Anonymous access remains the existing shared anonymous scope; this is
not a new per-human identity or login system.

Retain display filename, media type, extraction metadata and exact Markdown
heading/page-marker offsets. Do not infer PDF page anchors from a page count.
Document citation URLs resolve retained session text/spans, never acquire files
from an external or local path. Treat all extracted text as untrusted source data.
The ordinary session question/evidence path selects document and web refs together.
CLI and MCP expose the same admission/read/detach/query operations.

## Scope of Existing Decisions

- Extend ADR-0040 session coordination and ADR-0063 persistence offloading.
- Retain ADR-0071/0075 PostgreSQL retained-research authority unchanged. These
  attachments are explicitly session-lived evidence, not a durable research
  publication, backup guarantee, or longitudinal history authority.
- Retain ADR-0084 independent research roots. No automatic injection of old runs.
- Retain Parse extraction behavior and local-first OCR. No new OCR provider,
  embeddings, GPU work, raw binary archive, format conversion service or permissions.

## Consequences and Validation

Raw bytes are consumed/discarded after parsing; only exact extracted text and
provenance remain. Duplicate bytes are idempotent within a session, retaining the
first admitted extraction and filename. Detaching removes the source ref; historical
answers may still contain quotations, so complete removal uses session deletion.
Document refs share session TTL refresh/deletion and cannot outlive that authority.
Fixture tests exercise real local PDF table/DOCX heading parsers, exact Unicode
spans, mixed web/document questions, foreign scope, duplicate bytes, expiry,
concurrent quota admission, deletion and cancellation. Runtime CI verifies the
actual service boundaries; no production deployment is part of this change.
