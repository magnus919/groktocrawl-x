# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for GroktoCrawl.

## Fork scope

This index is local to the experimental `magnus919/groktocrawl-x` repository.
Inherited records describe the starting implementation; new records may replace
them here without changing upstream decisions. ADR-0067 proposes the experiment
charter. The [decision backlog and impact map](../experiments/research-architecture.md#architecture-decision-work)
plans the new architecture records and their acceptance evidence. Proposed
replacements are not current behavior and do not supersede accepted records yet.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs are immutable — existing records are never edited. If a decision changes, a new ADR is created and the old one is marked as superseded.

## Convention

- **Location:** `docs/adr/`
- **Naming:** `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md` (sequential numbers, imperative verb phrase)
- **Template:** [MADR](https://github.com/architecture-decision-record/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-of-the-madr-project) — structured with Status, Deciders, Date, Context, Decision Drivers, Considered Options, Outcome, and Links
- **Immutability:** ADRs are immutable. To change a decision, write a new ADR and update the old one's status to `superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
- **Linking:** ADRs reference each other via relative links (`[ADR-0001](0001-adapter-registry-pre-pipeline-hook.md)`)
- **Statuses:** `proposed`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `deprecated`, `superseded by ADR-NNNN`

## Index

**Status legend:** accepted ADRs describe decisions used by the current implementation. Proposed ADRs are design work, not promises of current behavior. Superseded ADRs are historical context only; use their successor when documenting current behavior.

**Current accepted decisions:** ADR-0001–0007, 0009–0012, 0014–0022, 0026, 0029–0035, 0038, 0039, 0043, 0044, 0045, 0046, 0047, 0048, 0049, 0050, 0051, 0052, 0053, 0054, 0055, 0056, 0057, and 0059–0066.

**Proposed work:** ADR-0023–0025, 0027, 0028, 0036, 0037, and 0040–0042, plus fork-local ADR-0067–0071.
