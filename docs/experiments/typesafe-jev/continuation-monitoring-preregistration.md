# Jev shadow experiments: continuation and saved-search change meaning

Status: **protocol frozen; case packets and labels are still pending. No live
Jev calls have been made.**

Tracking: GroktoCrawl X issues [#370](https://github.com/magnus919/groktocrawl-x/issues/370)
and [#373](https://github.com/magnus919/groktocrawl-x/issues/373). This is an
experimental, shadow-only study on `research/jev-continuation-monitoring`.
It does not change retrieval, saved-search delivery, notifications, or any
mainline service.

## Scope and baseline

The current SlopSearX source baseline already includes semantic reranking of
returned candidates, caller-directed adaptive search, and durable saved-search
result-change reports. This study does not re-evaluate reranking or rebuild
those execution and receipt primitives. It asks whether Jev adds useful
semantic judgment at the remaining caller boundaries:

1. **#370:** after the first-pass evidence has been reviewed, is another search
   semantically needed to close a specific evidence obligation?
2. **#373:** given an authoritative deterministic before/after page diff, does
   the actual content change matter to the user's saved intent?

The saved-search change identity is computed deterministically from the exact
before/after content supplied. Jev cannot declare a diff nonexistent, suppress
an event, or suppress a notification. Fetch failures are failed/unavailable
observations, never evidence that a page is irrelevant or unchanged.

## Frozen provider and execution limits

- Model: `jev-1.13.0`, endpoint `/v1/systemone`.
- Credential: process environment only; never print, persist, or include it in
  an artifact, command output, or commit.
- Maximum total live requests for both studies combined: **50**.
- Maximum in-flight requests: **1**. No retries. A transport, provider,
  validation, or timeout failure consumes its planned attempt and is recorded
  unevaluated.
- Each case is called once. No prompt, label, threshold, exclusion, or
  instruction changes after the first call. No calibration/validation mixing.
- Allocate at most 25 calls to each issue: up to 5 calibration and up to 20
  validation cases, frozen separately. Unused allocation is not reassigned to
  the other issue after results are seen.
- Private provider receipts stay outside version control unless separately
  cleared for publication. Public reports disclose aggregates only where the
  provider terms permit.

The live-call stage remains gated on a signed commit containing the case IDs,
input digests, reference labels, split, and this exact question contract.

## #370 first-pass continuation

### Unit and reference labels

The unit is one evidence obligation within one frozen first-pass research
snapshot. Label before calls with exactly one status:

- `met`: the first-pass evidence contains adequate evidence for this obligation;
- `unmet`: evidence is needed and not present in the acquired first pass;
- `contradiction`: relevant first-pass evidence conflicts on this obligation;
- `unanswerable`: the obligation cannot responsibly be resolved from the
  available public evidence, including when the relevant acquisition failed.

Also freeze `search_needed` (`yes`, `no`, or `uncertain`) and the specific
missing/contradictory claim. An acquisition failure itself is not a negative
relevance label. References are best-effort assistant assessments, not
independent gold labels; any independently reviewed labels must be marked as
such with reviewer and adjudication provenance.

### Jev judgment

Each call receives only the research question, one obligation, its frozen
first-pass evidence summary with stable source/work IDs, and the frozen
follow-up-search pool for that snapshot. Jev returns one `Choice`:

- `search`: a specific additional search is warranted for this obligation;
- `no_search`: first-pass evidence is sufficient or no useful search is
  supported by the frozen pool;
- `uncertain`: the supplied state does not justify either decision.

The judgment is advisory. Caller-directed adaptive search remains the execution
primitive and caller-selected follow-ups remain explicit. Jev does not formulate
or execute new queries in this study.

### Arms and outcomes

Report decision-only cases separately: Jev recommendation versus the
pre-labeled search-need assessment, with obligation status and all failures
visible. For cases with a frozen follow-up pool, replay the selected follow-up
against that pool and measure whether it contributes distinct evidence to an
unmet or contradictory obligation. Preserve the actual returned evidence and
work identity; count duplicate mirrors of one work once. Do not conflate a
correct recommendation with acquired additional evidence. Primary measures are
unmet-obligation recall, unnecessary-search rate among `met` obligations,
contradiction handling, distinct-work evidence gain, and additional-evidence
misses. Report denominators and exact counts; this small bounded study is
descriptive and does not support population-level significance claims.

## #373 saved-search change meaning

### Unit and reference labels

The unit is a deterministic before/after snapshot pair tied to one frozen user
intent. Prefer genuine public-page pairs with stable retrieval timestamps,
URLs, and hashes. Synthetic pairs are explicitly marked and reported apart.
Freeze at least these strata where supplied: material intent-relevant change,
boilerplate-only change, version-specific change, and fetch failure or missing
side. Preserve the full pair and deterministic diff identity. The human
reference label is `material`, `immaterial`, or `uncertain`, with a short
intent-specific rationale and provenance. Assistant assessments are
best-effort labels, not independent gold; failures and ambiguous cases stay
unevaluated/uncertain.

### Jev judgment and outcomes

Each call receives the saved intent, pair identity, and the deterministic
changed-content excerpt with before/after context. It returns a `Choice`:

- `material`: this confirmed content change could affect the saved intent;
- `immaterial`: this confirmed change does not materially affect the intent;
- `uncertain`: the supplied pair or intent is insufficient to judge.

Jev does not assess whether the page changed. The deterministic diff is the
authority for change identity. The model cannot suppress upstream change
reports, notices, or notifications. Compare its shadow assessment with the
frozen labels by stratum; prioritize false `immaterial` judgments on material
changes, and report `uncertain` and provider failures separately. Fetch-failure
pairs are protocol controls and are never scored as irrelevant page changes.

## Freeze, calibration, and validation

Case assembly, label review, protocol validation, and provider calibration are
separate stages. The first signed preregistration commit freezes the design;
the later signed case-freeze commit freezes case IDs, hashes, strata, split,
and labels. Calibration cases may validate the runner and questions but are
excluded from every validation metric. Validation IDs and labels are committed
before any calls. If fewer cases are available, keep the fixed per-issue split
and report the shortfall; do not manufacture a held-out set from repeated
synthetic variants. If authentic #373 pairs are unavailable, mark that study
incomplete rather than treating synthetic performance as public-page evidence.

The evidence package records source revision, packet hashes, exact strata and
denominators, reference provenance, call status, response validation,
latency, usage if provided, and any deviations. Calibration is not claimed from
Jev confidence alone. No threshold is selected or tuned in these studies.

## Stop and interpretation rules

Stop before calls if data rights are unresolved, the packet includes private,
authenticated, personal, or sensitive content, the key would enter persistent
logs, or the frozen packet exceeds 50 calls. Stop execution on any evidence of
credential exposure or user-visible influence. A failed call remains
unevaluated, not irrelevant; no replacement call is allowed. Report all
deviations and retain negative or inconclusive results. These experiments can
motivate a later proposal but do not authorize integration, deployment, a new
default, notification suppression, or a change to Hermes/mainline.
