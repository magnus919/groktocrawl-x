# Experimental replacement candidate

This runbook deploys the `groktocrawl-x` replacement candidate as an isolated
experiment. It does not replace the mainline GroktoCrawl project or switch the
existing production deployment. The candidate has its own Compose project,
containers, images, networks, volumes, database, and separately configurable
published ports.

The first candidate uses PostgreSQL as the authority for retained research
artifacts and pgvector for semantic serving. Qdrant remains in the candidate as
an unchanged rollback target until the migration and rollback rehearsal in W9
is complete. The incumbent deployment is not a rollback target and is never
mutated by this procedure.

## Frozen topology

| Responsibility | Candidate service | Durable state |
|---|---|---|
| Job and execution coordination | `candidate-valkey` | `candidate_valkey_data` |
| Research artifact authority | `candidate-postgres` | `candidate_postgres_data` |
| Semantic serving | `candidate-semantic` using pgvector | PostgreSQL projection |
| Semantic rollback | `candidate-qdrant-rollback` | `candidate_qdrant_rollback_data` |
| Web discovery | `candidate-slopsearx` | Valkey cache only |
| Acquisition | `candidate-scraper` and `candidate-browser` | candidate browser cache |
| HTTP research API | `candidate-agent` | PostgreSQL and Valkey above |
| Portal health dependency | `candidate-portal` | no independent durable authority |
| MCP transport | `candidate-mcp` | no independent durable authority |

Only the HTTP API and MCP transport publish ports. Both bind to `127.0.0.1` by
default. Set `CANDIDATE_BIND_IP` to a specific trusted interface, or to
`0.0.0.0` when the host's network policy is the intended boundary. When MCP is
reachable beyond loopback, list every expected Host value in
`MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. The HTTP API remains protected by
`CANDIDATE_API_KEY`; the MCP transport carries that credential internally and
must be exposed only on a trusted network. The project name is fixed as
`groktocrawl-x-candidate`; every service and volume also carries a
candidate-specific name. Do not combine this file with `docker-compose.yml`.

## Prepare a clean target

Check out the exact reviewed revision on the target host. Then create private
credentials outside the repository in persistent per-user storage:

```sh
umask 077
export CANDIDATE_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/groktocrawl-x-candidate"
mkdir -p "$CANDIDATE_CONFIG"
chmod 700 "$CANDIDATE_CONFIG"
openssl rand -hex 32 > "$CANDIDATE_CONFIG/postgres-password"
openssl rand -hex 32 > "$CANDIDATE_CONFIG/api-key"
cp .env.experimental-candidate.sample "$CANDIDATE_CONFIG/candidate.env"
chmod 600 "$CANDIDATE_CONFIG/postgres-password" \
  "$CANDIDATE_CONFIG/api-key" \
  "$CANDIDATE_CONFIG/candidate.env"
```

Do not put these files under `/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, or `/var/tmp`. Compose reads
the PostgreSQL credential from its host path whenever it creates the container;
a host cleanup or restart can therefore make the stack impossible to recreate.

Edit `$CANDIDATE_CONFIG/candidate.env`:

- set `CANDIDATE_IMAGE_TAG` to the full checked-out Git revision;
- set the PostgreSQL password-file path to the file just created;
- set `CANDIDATE_API_KEY` to the value in the API-key file;
- leave `CANDIDATE_BIND_IP=127.0.0.1` for host-local use, or set the intended
  trusted interface and matching `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` values;
- set the working LiteLLM TLS URL and private key for `inference.example.internal`;
- set the SlopSearX search-provider key.
- set `SEMANTIC_CPU_LIMIT` to the CPU capacity available for local embedding
  inference; the portable default is 2 cores.

The checked-in sample selects LiteLLM's `free` model alias. Keep secrets in
the private environment and credential files; never add them to a receipt or
commit them. Validate the private files before invoking Compose:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_experimental_candidate_config.py \
  "$CANDIDATE_CONFIG/candidate.env"
```

On a genuinely clean target, this command must return no candidate resources:

```sh
docker ps -a --filter label=com.docker.compose.project=groktocrawl-x-candidate
docker volume ls --filter label=com.docker.compose.project=groktocrawl-x-candidate
```

If it lists resources, preserve them and investigate their owner. Do not delete
volumes merely to make the clean-start check pass.

## Resolve, build, and start

Use the same file and private environment for every command:

```sh
export CANDIDATE_ENV="$HOME/.config/groktocrawl-x-candidate/candidate.env"
export CANDIDATE_COMPOSE=compose.experimental-candidate.yml

python3 scripts/validate_experimental_candidate_config.py "$CANDIDATE_ENV"
docker compose --env-file "$CANDIDATE_ENV" -f "$CANDIDATE_COMPOSE" config --quiet
docker compose --env-file "$CANDIDATE_ENV" -f "$CANDIDATE_COMPOSE" config --services
docker compose --env-file "$CANDIDATE_ENV" -f "$CANDIDATE_COMPOSE" build --pull
docker compose --env-file "$CANDIDATE_ENV" -f "$CANDIDATE_COMPOSE" up -d --wait
```

There are no fixed sleeps. Compose waits for the declared health checks. On the
first start, PostgreSQL applies the ordered research migrations through schema
14, and the semantic service creates the pgvector projection before becoming
ready. The semantic health response must identify pgvector as the serving store
and Qdrant as rollback-ready.

## Verify and freeze the receipt

Load only the candidate API key into the verifier process and write the receipt
outside the repository first:

```sh
export CANDIDATE_API_KEY=$(docker compose \
  --env-file "$CANDIDATE_ENV" -f "$CANDIDATE_COMPOSE" \
  exec -T candidate-agent printenv API_KEY)
UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/groktocrawl-x-uv-cache uv run --with httpx \
  scripts/verify_experimental_candidate.py \
  --env-file "$CANDIDATE_ENV" \
  --compose-file "$CANDIDATE_COMPOSE" \
  --output /tmp/groktocrawl-x-candidate-receipt.json
```

The verifier fails unless all of these complete:

- aggregate service health;
- PostgreSQL research schema 14 and the pgvector extension;
- the experimental capability document identifying PostgreSQL artifact authority;
- one admitted research run, completed artifact set, and terminal SSE replay;
- retrieval of the manifest plus summary, analysis, and dossier bytes;
- one real SlopSearX search through HTTP and through the repository CLI;
- bounded text and structured-output requests through the configured model
  provider and model alias;
- MCP initialization and the `research_capabilities` tool;
- capture of the source revision, lockfile and Compose hashes, resolved container
  image identities, and running service state.

The JSON receipt deliberately excludes environment values, credentials, private
addresses, and artifact bodies. Review it before copying it into the W9 evidence
packet.

Container health and ordinary search only prove that the API and retrieval
dependencies are reachable. They do not prove that the configured model alias
can serve research work. The two model probes are therefore readiness gates;
their receipt records only readiness, HTTP class, and latency.

## Run a time-gated pilot checkpoint

Use the checkpoint runner for restart checkpoint 0, checkpoint 1, and checkpoint
2. It reads the tracked
pilot state, refuses an early or out-of-order checkpoint, resolves the effective
API key from the running container rather than parsing quoted environment text,
runs the compatibility and cross-client research journeys, captures a bounded
resource snapshot, and publishes the packet only after every step succeeds.

```sh
UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/groktocrawl-x-uv-cache uv run --no-project \
  --with httpx --with requests python \
  scripts/run_w9_pilot_checkpoint.py \
  --checkpoint 0 \
  --env-file "$CANDIDATE_ENV" \
  --compose-file "$CANDIDATE_COMPOSE" \
  --output-dir /tmp/w9-checkpoint-0
```

When the deployed candidate uses an override, pass each Compose file in
deployment order with another `--compose-file` flag. The runner and its
research verifier then inspect the effective stack and hash all supplied
Compose files. Set `CANDIDATE_IMAGE_TAG` in the runner environment to the
deployed revision when the private env file still names an older tag.

After a passed restart checkpoint, use `--checkpoint 1` and then
`--checkpoint 2`, each with a new output directory. A
failure packet is retained beside the requested output path with a `.failed-*`
suffix. Do not rename it into a successful packet or advance the tracked pilot
state. After success, review the secret-free receipts, copy them into the W9
evidence directory, update `w9-pilot-state.json`, and commit them together.

If a candidate image or configuration changes, end the old window and clear
its active timing gates in the tracked state. Before rerunning checkpoint 0,
record the new exact runtime and configuration baseline plus its start time;
the runner intentionally rejects a state with no start time. Prior successful
requests remain historical evidence, not credit toward the new window.

After checkpoint 2 and the tracked-state update, verify the entire frozen
window before writing or accepting the replacement decision:

```sh
python scripts/verify_w9_closeout.py \
  --checkpoint-dir docs/experiments/evidence/replacement-rehearsal/<checkpoint-0> \
  --checkpoint-dir docs/experiments/evidence/replacement-rehearsal/<checkpoint-1> \
  --checkpoint-dir docs/experiments/evidence/replacement-rehearsal/<checkpoint-2> \
  --output docs/experiments/evidence/replacement-rehearsal/w9-closeout-verification.json
```

The verifier fails closed unless all packets belong to the one tracked
revision, their receipt digests match, the `free` model and completed
research journey were observed each time, the 72-hour and seven-day gates
elapsed, all three checkpoint numbers are present, and the packet total proves
at least 30 successful operations. A failing report is retained evidence for a
revise or reject decision; it must not be rewritten into a passing state.

## Stop without destroying evidence

```sh
docker compose --env-file "$CANDIDATE_ENV" -f "$CANDIDATE_COMPOSE" stop
```

Use `start` followed by the verifier for the restart check. `down` removes
containers and networks while preserving named volumes. Do not use `down -v`;
volume removal belongs only to the later, separately reviewed retirement step.

## Failure boundary

If candidate readiness or verification fails, stop admitting experimental work,
capture `docker compose ps` and service logs, and leave the incumbent deployment
unchanged. During the pgvector rehearsal, switching the candidate semantic mode
back to Qdrant is the rollback operation. Deleting PostgreSQL or Qdrant data is
never part of rollback.
